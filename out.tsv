We have to say NO

"Croatian Environment and Energy Minister Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and hopes to find a total solution."
"In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic division urged Croatia to find another location in the part of the country closer to the plant."
“Why is Croatia with all its territory saying that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?” asked Drljaca.

The American Congress has agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
"The US Congress did not object to the transaction for the statutory 15 days from the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-role fighters, which means that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began."
"The Congressional decision, while not unexpected, is of great political importance."
"""After the sale has been approved by the Department of State, and now by Congress, I don't see any major obstacles,"" said John V. Venable, senior defense policy adviser for Washington Conservative Heritage Foundation think tank."
"The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days prior to signing the contract, if any The amount of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to a NATO member state, exceeds USD 50 million."
"The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $ 6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, ancillary equipment and pilot training."
"The main supplier of the F-35 aircraft - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the American defense company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A fighters, Pratt and Whitney ."
Proposals for the purchase of American fifth-generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted in May by Minister of Defense Mariusz BÅ‚aszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump in the White House.
"The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program."
"As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others Patriot anti-missile system."
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of the bid by Poland was - without armaments and technical assistance - about $ 89.2 million.
"According to PAP, American military experts who wished to remain anonymous, such a price given in the preliminary negotiations was ""the maximum price, much higher than the price that would be negotiated"" ."
"""Prices are plummeting, currently the price of one F-35 is under $ 80 million, much less than the Eurofighter, which does not have the same advantages as the F-35,"" Venable pointed out."
PAP interlocutors expressed their hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of American combat aircraft by Poland will be completed this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction - ie the offset - will be discussed directly with the American manufacturers of F-35 fighters.
